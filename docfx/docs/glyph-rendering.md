The glyph rendering is process that takes 8-bit output from the font rasterizer and converts it to 32-bit RGBA glyph image.
It is possible to control the glyph rendering using following FontSystemSettings properties:
* FontSystemSettings.GlyphRenderResult
* FontSystemSettings.GlyphRenderer

### FontSystemSettings.GlyphRenderResult
This is enum that has following values:
```c#
  /// <summary>
  /// Determines how to produce final image(RGBA) from the rasterizer 8-bit source value
  /// </summary>
  public enum GlyphRenderResult
  {
    /// <summary>
    /// RGBA set to the source value. Default option
    /// </summary>
    Premultiplied,

    /// <summary>
    /// RGB set to 255 and A set to the source value
    /// </summary>
    NonPremultiplied,

    /// <summary>
    /// RGBA set to 255 if the source value is non-zero. Otherwise RGBA set to 0
    /// </summary>
    NoAntialiasing
  }
```

I.e. following code would create FontSystem with disabled antialiasing(which is required for some pixel perfect fonts):
```c#
  FontSystemSettings settings = new settings();
  settings.GlyphRenderResult = GlyphRenderResult.NoAntialiasing;
  FontSystem fontSystem = new FontSystem(settings);
```

The difference between default glyph rendering and disabled antialiasing is demonstrated on this image.
Top line is default glyph rendering, bottom is using above code:

That is screenshot from this sample: https://github.com/FontStashSharp/FontStashSharp/tree/main/samples/FontStashSharp.Samples.DisableAntialiasing

### FontSystemSettings.GlyphRenderer
This is delegate with following definition:
```c#
  public delegate void GlyphRenderer(byte[] input, byte[] output, GlyphRenderOptions options);
```

It allows to hack into the process of the glyph rendering to the texture atlas.
It consists of 3 arguments:

1. **input** is 8-bit byte buffer, generated by the glyph rasterizer, where every byte corresponds to the color/alpha of a pixel.
2. **output** is 32-bit byte buffer that is build by the developer and allows to control final image of the glyph.
3. **options** is various options such as glyph size or what effects are used.

The default implementation of GlyphRenderer is here: https://github.com/FontStashSharp/FontStashSharp/blob/8f976111096b77cf769c72fa61096381740d5489/src/FontStashSharp/GlyphRenderers.cs#L147

Following example code sets GlyphRenderer to custom implementation that disables the antialiasing(which is basically similar to setting `GlyphRenderResult` to `GlyphRenderResult.NoAntialiasing`):
```c#
  var settings = new FontSystemSettings();

  settings.GlyphRenderer = (input, output, options) =>
  {
    var size = options.Size.X * options.Size.Y;

    for (var i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
      var c = input[i];
      var ci = i * 4;

      if (c == 0)
      {
        output[ci] = output[ci + 1] = output[ci + 2] = output[ci + 3] = 0;
      } else
      {
        output[ci] = output[ci + 1] = output[ci + 2] = output[ci + 3] = 255;
      }
    }
  };

  var result = new FontSystem(settings);
```
